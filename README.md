EDA on Netflix datasets and based on content and collocating flittering to build recommendation system.

Name: Yan Chai

Describtion:
In this final project, I my job could split two parts. In the first notebook(netflix.ipynb), I merged Netflix and IMDB datasets got from Kaggle and tried to
find out some interesting information. Specifically, based on differnet aspects including age group, gender, contients and genres to find out top movies, and 
based on countries, years and genres to find out the distribution of TV shows and movies. In the second notebook(Recommendation,ipynb), I used two algorithms 
including content-based and collaborative flitering(model based) to build movie recommendation system. In the first method, the recommendation system could recomend 
movies based on what the users type, and in the second method, the recommendation could based on the movies that the users have rated predict the ratings and recomendhigher ratings movies to users.
